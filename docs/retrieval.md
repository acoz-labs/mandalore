# Retrieval quality and efficiency

Issue #9 is in progress. This guide records the evaluation method, not a claim
that corpus-scale performance or native efficiency has already passed acceptance.
Mandalore keeps scoped current evidence separate from history, conflicts and
foundling references. Exact-byte bounds and accurate evidence take precedence
over a smaller but misleading answer.

## Correctness baseline

`TestRetrievalQualityMatrix` exercises the public memory service against synthetic
global/project preferences, renamed projects, retained aliases, historical-only
words, same-keyword projects, future-effective revisions, concurrent heads,
no-match and paginated scope discovery. It asserts exact IDs, omission/conflict
counts, bounded complete responses and unchanged files. Known lexical misses
are labeled; they are not semantic search successes. In the initial baseline,
an absent synonym and a terminal period on a word both miss. The period case
was discovered by the fixture sanity test, not hidden by the benchmark.

`TestRetrievalSameServiceObservesExternalChanges` holds one reader open while
another writer adds, corrects and branches a record, then introduces corruption
and replaces the signet identity. The reader must see new local evidence or
refuse invalid/replaced data without a restart. Existing integrity, real-Git,
budget and scope tests remain required too.

## Reproduce measurements

Use Go 1.26.4 on a disposable development checkout. These opt-in benchmarks create
only synthetic temporary banks/references. They do not use native authentication,
an installed agent binding, remote repositories or private memory.

```sh
mise exec go@1.26.4 -- go test ./internal/testfixture ./internal/memory -run 'TestCorpus|TestNearestRank|TestRetrieval' -count=1
mise exec go@1.26.4 -- go test ./internal/memory -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkRetrieval$' -benchtime=20x -count=1 -timeout=20m
mise exec go@1.26.4 -- go test ./internal/codex -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkPromptHook$' -benchtime=20x -count=1 -timeout=20m
mise exec go@1.26.4 -- go test ./internal/foundlings -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkFoundlingRetrieval$' -benchtime=20x -count=1 -timeout=20m
mise exec go@1.26.4 -- go test ./cmd/mandalore -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkCompiledRetrieval$' -benchtime=20x -count=1 -timeout=20m
```

Memory cases use 100/1000/10000 records, plus independent 1000-record depth-2,
depth-10 and conflict variants. Ten explicit scopes share terms. Each revision
has a source object and realistic compact prose. The shared test-only generator
writes canonical objects to a fresh test directory and validates the complete
bank before timing. It is not a supported production writer. Fixture creation
and validation are excluded from measured operation time, not from total command
duration. Small generator tests independently check counts and current/conflicting
heads before its output is trusted.

Memory measurements cover narrow, broad, empty and no-match reads, fresh service
opening plus recall, and scope pages. Prompt-hook measurements include the actual
read-only adapter, default recall, routing inventory and emitted JSON. Foundling
measurements cover separate 100/1000-file references with source verification,
not just string matching. Compiled CLI measurements include process startup,
binding/recall/encoding, pipe transfer and client decoding/validation from an
unrelated working directory. Build and fixture setup are excluded.

## Interpret the units honestly

- `ns/op`, `B/op`, `allocs/op`: Go benchmark operation mean and benchmark-process
  allocation accounting. Compiled CLI allocation figures describe the parent,
  not the child process. Operations include result serialization and a small
  per-sample clock/bookkeeping cost.
- `p50-ms`, `p95-ms`: nearest-rank samples measured per operation, reported only
  with at least 20 iterations. They are not derived from the Go benchmark mean.
- `result-B/op`: actual average serialized returned bytes, not a requested
  maximum or token estimate. CLI includes its envelope/newline; memory measures
  compact result JSON; hooks include the emitted envelope/newline.
- Fixture logs: current record identities, total revisions, conflicts, files
  and bytes. History and referenced source files count toward real I/O.

Warm means repeated filesystem-backed reads of a validated fixture, not a
persistent memory cache. Fresh service/process does not mean cold disk: the OS
page cache is not flushed. No administrator privileges or cache-clearing commands
are used. Record exact source head, environment, commands, sample counts and raw
outputs; host timings do not establish a universal SLA or native Linux acceptance.
Run suites sequentially for comparable host evidence, not concurrently.

## Native context and follow-up

Schema sizes, tool response bytes, hook text, requested context ceilings and
native aggregate token counters are distinct. Prior foundling tests observed
a 16000-byte recall request for two records and a repeat read of an already
complete source excerpt. Neither alone proves a billed-token regression. See
[native foundling evidence](evidence/foundlings-native/README.md).

Record actual ordered calls, returned sizes, needed provenance/recovery versus
redundant reads, correct final results and no-save preservation before tuning
native guidance. Do not optimize by suppressing conflict/history or skipping a
fresh read after relevant state changes. Candidate acceptance remains #10/#11.

Provisional investigation triggers are warm scoped p95 over 250 ms or fresh
process p95 over one second at 1000 current records, and more than two redundant
retrieval calls in a simple scoped task after guidance correction. These trigger
profiling and a scoped follow-up, not automatic index installation or a timing
assertion in CI. Any future index must be rebuildable, detect external changes,
preserve exact identity/scope/graph semantics and need no mandatory inference
service. No specific index or semantic package is selected.
